# malware-analysis

This Malware Analysis repo exists as a kind of self-developed "curriculum" and resource hub, as tooling for the mutual self-education of all those interested in learning about "malicious" software (malware), methods of analysis, reverse engineering, disassembly, and so forth, in a context that does not aim for professionalization, in a format that is mutually beneficial to all who share and add to these resources and can be approached and experimented with at one's own pace.

<i>Remember to be very careful when dealing with live malware samples.</i>
